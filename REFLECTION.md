# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I just went with a standard weekday and ordered some of the activities I might encounter linearly. I played around with the timing a bit to make it feel realistic, allotting different amounts of time to certain activities based on their real-time length. 

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
I had the most trouble working out a system to actually edit and test the HTML file itself. It was unlike the previous projects, which were js. I wasn't sure how to open and edit an HTML file, since clicking into it from my files automatically opens it and prompts it to run in the browser. I ended up doing the work in GitHub, then syncing the changes to my copy of the file and testing it from there. 

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
I like the element of control that comes with async timing. In regular programming, things tend to happen at lightning speed. So, if you have a few outputs going to the console, they will pretty much all show up instantaneously. The time staggering allows for more dynamic elements, making the experience more cinematic for the user.

## What creative element did you add?
I threw in some emojis to highlight certain events, like the sun rising or a cup of coffee.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
The simulation is obviously not in real time - it could be made that way, but it would be incredibly boring and tedious to watch. It also assumes that precise things will happen at fixed times, whereas the real-world timeline is more subject to deviation.
